## About this program
This lab implements a recursive formula for calculating the determinant of a matrix. 

The output of this program is each input matrix as a 2-D array, followed by its determinant.

Java Version: OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11+28, mixed mode)

## Running this program
The java code has already been compiled, to run it, please navigate to the ```src``` folder
and run the following command:
```
java lab_1/Test.java {output-file-name} {input-file-name-1} ... {input-file-name-n}
```
where file-name-i is a .txt file with integer, square input matrices.
Elements of the matrix must be separated by one space.
There should be no empty lines separating matrices.
